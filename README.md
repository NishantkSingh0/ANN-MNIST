# Subclassing Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) for MNIST & Fashion MNIST classification.

# Overview
This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) trained to classify MNIST & Fashion-MNIST dataset.

# Model Architecture
The FFN model is defined using the subclassing method in TensorFlow/Keras. Here's a brief overview of the architecture:
