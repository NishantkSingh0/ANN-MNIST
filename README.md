# Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) for MNIST Digit Classification
# Overview
This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) trained to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model achieves an accuracy of 99.55% on the test set.

# Model Architecture
The FFN model is defined using the subclassing method in TensorFlow/Keras. Here's a brief overview of the architecture:
